# Powerhouse Gym 

## Milestone project 1: User-centric front-end development

This website is to present to potential gym members to join our gym. The website will highlight the reasons why they should join by showcasing what benefits they may experience with us.

### Demo

### UX
As a future gym member I am looking for a gym that has fun classes and trainers who will encourage me.
I'll be looking for the classes they provide and if they are beginner friendly.
I'll also be looking for convienience.

### Strategy
My goal is to design a website that’s easy to use and access information. A website that is easy to navigate.

### Scope
For potential consumers, I would want to provide them reasons on why they should join the gym.

### Structure
On the first home page I wanted to have a sales pitch on why they should join the gym. To get them interested and have them look around the website.

### Skeleton
Here are the wireframes I done before the project, to help me get started.
