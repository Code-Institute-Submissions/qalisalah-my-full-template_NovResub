### Demo

### UX
As a future gym member I am looking for a gym that has fun classes and trainers who will encourage me.
I'll be looking for the classes they provide and if they are beginner friendly.
My goal is to design a website thatâ€™s easy to use and access information. A website that is easy to navigate.
For potential consumers, I would want to provide them reasons on why they should join the gym. make the website easy to navigate and get all the information they cann

### Design 
* Colour Scheme ; Black, Blue, White and Grey.
* Typography
 *  Roboto font will be used throught my website. If the font doesnt work, the fall back will be Sans Serif.
* Imagery 
 * To use images that match my theme. to make the feel of the website modern. 
   
On the first home page I wanted to have a sales pitch on why they should join the gym. To get them interested and have them look around the website.
